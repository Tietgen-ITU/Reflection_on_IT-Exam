\section{Discussion}
This section is first going to discuss if the roadpricing technology is going to violate privacy. Secondly, the discussion section is going to touch upon some ethical views of using this technology.
Since the roadpricing technology is not yet in the final stages, we are going to assume that the technology sends GPS locations and timestamps to the danish tax authorities. Furthermore, that if this becomes a law, that the danish people do not have a choice other than to install this black box tracking device into their cars. 

Looking at the solution from the perspective of Warren and Brandeis right to privacy definition, the danish people should be protected from exposing ones thougts, sentiments and emotions from being shared. As information about locations and timestamp doesn't reveal any information about an individuals intentions thougts or anything else in that matter, it does not violate their definition on privacy. 
% Prosser

To some degree, the four interests of privacy by Prosser, would agree. 
As his first interests states, the "Intrusion upon a person's seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs". In Prossers eyes this would be violated, mainly due to the last part of the sentence, "private affairs". By exposing the location of an individual would intrude an individuals private affairs. Private affairs isn't very narrow. If the individual is known for being healthy, but goes out to get ice cream. Then the location could reveal that the individual has been to a place known for getting ice cream, thus revealling a private affair to the public.  
Looking at the second interest, it states that "public disclosure of embarrasing private facts about an individual" would violate privacy. At first glance, looking at the locations of an individual wouldn't reveal much information. However, in the situation where the location ends at a location such as red-light district, would for some individuals be an embarrasing private thing to reveal to the public. Thus, this scenario does reveal embarrasing facts about the whereabouts about an individual, violating privacy concerns. Prossers third privacy interest, "Publicity placing one in a false light in the public eye" could in some sense be violated. In a world where everyone only drives a car that each individual have bought, wouldn't reveal any false information to the public. In fact, the system is designed to know exactly where the car has been. However, a car could be used by anyone. Since the car is registered to a specific person it would look the individual drove the car to some particular place in the eye of the public. Since everyone can drive the car, then it could also have been a family member who used the car in the particular moment. This could potentially place a specific person at a location that the individual may not have been at, making it violate the third interest as well. 
The last interest of privacy could also be violated. It states that the "Appropriation of one's likeness for the advantage of another". However, this is only violated in the situation where the information about the whereabouts of the individual is leaked and used in some sort of smear campaign, that puts someone else in a better light.  
% Alan Westin

Alan Westin would agree that roadpricing violates one's privacy. But from another perspective. His view is focused on the control of information i.e. when, how and to what extent the information is used. As this is going to be a law the issue is that the individual does not have much to say. Meaning, the individual is not free to choose the car as transport without being tracked. Also, the solution about how they are being tracked is not up to the individual either, being that this is imposed by the government. Furthermore, to what extent is not yet stated by government. One could imagine a world where the government initially only shares this information wiht the danish tax authorities, but later allows the police to use similar information to fight crime. The individual does not have much to say about the control of to what extent their information is used, and for that reason roadpricing violates Alan Westins view as well.  

% Ruth Garvison
Looking from the perspective of access, Ruth Garvison, there is a more loose view on privacy. According to Garvison there is privacy and perfect privacy. Based on the three properties, namely secrecy, anonymity, and solitude nearly all of them is violated, hence not providing perfect privacy. This is due to the property of solitude, which Garvison defines as "no one has physical access to one". Since roadpricing only focuses on sending pieces of location information from the individual car, then there is no physical aspect, when it comes to getting access to the individual. However, this does mean that there is some level of privacy since not all properties are violated. \\
