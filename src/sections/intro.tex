\section{Introduction}
Denmark has always been a country that is proud to say that they are an example for the rest of the world when it comes to the green initiatives and saving the climate. There have been a lot of the different investments over the years like lowering taxes of electric cars, providing money to get rid of oil-fired boiler, and building huge wind turbine farms in the middle of the sea. However, there has also in the last decade been a push from the governments to limit the cars being driven in big cities like Copenhagen. In the late 2011 and the early 2012 a proposal to let car owners pay in order to enter with their vehicle in the city of Copenhagen was presented. The idea was to  force car owners to take public transport when traveling into Copenhagen rather than the car. This obviously infuriated car owners driving to work every day, now having to pay more in taxes, but also arguing that it would take longer for them to get to work because public transport is not fit for the task. 10 years later the discussion has returned. However, the idea is not completely the same. The idea is called roadpricing. Roadpricing is a tax that is being added to the driver when the car has been driven around the country. The idea is not fully thought out, but the government are trying testing solutions to see how it works in practice. The key difference is that this is not a one time payment only in Copenhagen. This is a tax for the driver depending on which road the car has been on. While there were heavy disagreement between politicians the last time, now they are more open-minded to the idea. The politicians is looking at this from a financial perspective, telling that it is a fair solution. However, politicians are not talking about the technology that the government are testing in order to make this happen in practice. The solution is to add a black box to every car. The black box is a GPS tracker that sends information to the danish tax payment institute called skat.dk regarding the whereabouts of the driver and at what time. \newline

\noindent This paper will look take another perspective than the economical. First it will go through the literature study, then explain how to apply the theory which later will lead into the discussion. The section will state the conclusion.

During this paper it will try and answer the following philosophical questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does GPS tracking violate the privacy of the common people?
    \item It is ethical to use GPS tracking technology in order to add taxes?
\end{itemize}
