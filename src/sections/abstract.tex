\section*{Abstract}
The danish government has initiated research about how to implement Roadpricing. One of the solutions is to implement a black box that tracks the car postion with GPS and sends it to the danish tax authorities. Many of the politicians have discussed the economic benefits and environmental, but what about the privacy and ethical concerns? By looking at control of information and privacy in terms of access, the majority of the defintions do say that implementing roadpricing violates the individauls privacy. However, when it comes to ethics there are some mixed results in favor of and against roadpricing, making it hard to determine if roadpricing is unethical.
